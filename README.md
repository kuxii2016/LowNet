## LowNet

Unity3d Network System written in C#

System is easy to use as there is a wide range of components to choose from.

Network system is a 2 layer system

Based on TCP and UDP protocol.

*TCP socket is a default type.*<br>
*UDP can be used but does not have to be.*

There are numerous components included in the dll which allows people with 0 lines of code to sync things <br>
(like with the old Unity Unet) including Animator Sync Component,
Simpler Player Controller, Object Spawner and Manager.

It is not 100% finished in the current status, but is still being developed!
Own packages can be easily added with. 
And system own can be overwritten (can break components).
